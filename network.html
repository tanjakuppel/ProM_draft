				<p>Prosopographical data in general can be divided into two types. The first one provides information about
					individual identities. Thus, prosopographic data forms the basic requirement for the manifestation of personal and
					social identities within a social community.</p>
				<p>As a second type, prosopographical data is relational data which describe the interconnections and relations of
					individual persons, who can be assigned to a network of persons. Thus, prosopographical data is not just a
					criterion
					to identify a person, but it is a network parameter which forms the common basis for connecting people within the
					same network. According to Pierre Bourdieu (Bourdieu 1983: 191), those reciprocal personal interrelations generate
					social capital and as aresult, the social position and social status of an individual is strengthened by the
					participation to a network of persons. The participation to a group or a network can be defined by social and
					genealogical
					affiliations, gender, institutional background and geographic origin.</p>

				<p>The basic principle of network studies is, that neither individuals nor social groups form the basic components
					of a
					social community, but the social relations, which are manifested in social networks (Düring –von Keyserlingk
					2015: 338).
					A prosopographical network is a set of individual actors of a historical group of persons and their relations. By
					network
					analysis those relational pattern scan be investigated by using graph theory (Prell 2012: 9). Within a network
					graph each person is represented by a node and each connection is shown as an edge. An individual might be
					connected
					to any other member of the network in a direct way, for example in case of genealogical affiliations. But as it
					has
					been already stated by the American psychologist Stanley Milgram (Milgram 1967: 60–70), individuals can be linked
					to
					each other indirectly by the common connection to other people as well. The shape of the network is irrelevant and
					nodes can be placed anywhere, but to create a network, nodes have to be connected by edges. In addition, there are
					many network measures to describe the features of a network, either as a whole, as well as those of individual
					nodes and edges (Prell 2012: 96– 114). But what does this statistical measurement reveal about the relational
					patterns of the network?</p>
				<p class="citation">"If two persons arefive removes apart, they are far apart indeed. [...] Thus, when we speak of
					five intermediaries, weare talking about an enormous psychological distance between the starting and target
					points,a
					distance which seems small only because we customarily regard ‘five’ as a small manageablequantity."(Milgram 1967:
					67)
				</p>
				<p>In this way, statistical measurements of personal interrelations within a network have to be valuated with
					criticism, since it does rather describe the quantitative features of a network and its individual nodesand ties,
					than the quality of individual relations. According to Milgram’s observation, it has tobe stated that although the
					distance between two individuals seems to be remarkably small, it is not evident if they were conscious of the
					fact that they participate to the same network and were connected by common acquaintances. As it has been
					mentioned above, prosopographical networks do not document the quality of social interrelations between individual
					actors based on personal contacts and therefore network graphs cannot be interpreted as an accurate reflection of
					the
					socio-historical past.
				</p>
				<p>Although its application is neither limited to specific historical cultures, periods nor specific questions of
					research interest, historical network studies applied on data from ancient cultures does not occurregularly before
					the 2010s (Maczak 2005; Graham 2006a; Graham 2006b: 359– 362; Ruffini –Graham 2007: 325–336). For Egyptology this
					method has so far been used only occasionally and remains mostly limited to Greco-Roman times, since for this
					period it is possible tooperate with large datasets of complex qualities (Tambs 2019; Tambs 2015: 22–30; see
					also:Broux 2017: 137–146; Broux 2016: 303–312). Only very recently projects start to include network studies into
					their investigation of material dating to pharaonic times, such as ÉmilieMartinets study on provincial
					administration during the Old Kingdom (Martinet 2013; Martinet2019), Veronika Dulíkovás and Radek Maříks work
					on Old Kingdom nepotism networks usingdatasets from Abusir (Dulíková – Mařík 2017: 63–83; Dulíková – Mařík
					2019; Mařík 2019), theexamination of the Amarna letter corpus by Eric and Diane Cline (Cline – Cline 2015:
					17–44) aswell as the investigation of relational patterns of upper Egyptian elites in the New Kingdom,which has
					been done as a PhD research project by Vincent Chollier (Chollier 2017; Chollier2019).
