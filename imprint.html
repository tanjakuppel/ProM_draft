				<h2>Privacy Policy</h2>
				<p>
					Personal data (usually referred to just as "data" below) will only be
					processed by us to the extent necessary and for the purpose of providing a
					functional and user-friendly website, including its contents, and the services offered there.
				</p>
				<p>
					Per Art. 4 No. 1 of Regulation (EU) 2016/679, i.e. the General Data
					Protection Regulation (hereinafter referred to as the "GDPR"), "processing"
					refers to any operation or set of operations such as collection, recording,
					organization, structuring, storage, adaptation, alteration, retrieval,
					consultation, use, disclosure by transmission, dissemination, or otherwise
					making available, alignment, or combination, restriction, erasure, or
					destruction performed on personal data, whether by automated means or not.
				</p>
				<p>
					The following privacy policy is intended to inform you in particular
					about the type, scope, purpose, duration, and legal basis for the
					processing of such data either under our own control or in conjunction
					with others. We also inform you below about the third-party components
					we use to optimize our website and improve the user experience which
					may result in said third parties also processing data they collect and control.
				</p>
				<p>Our privacy policy is structured as follows:</p>
				<p>
					I. Information about us as controllers of your data<br>
					II. The rights of users and
					data subjects<br>
					III. Information about the data processing
				</p>
				<h4>I. Information about us as controllers of your data</h4>
				<p>
					The party responsible for this website for
					purposes of data protection law is:
				</p>
				<p>Dr. Anne Herzberg-Beiersdorf</p>
				<p>Humboldt-Universität zu Berlin<br>
					Institut für Archäologie | Archäologie und Kulturgeschichte Nordostafrikas<br>
					Unter den Linden 6<br>
					10099 Berlin
				</p>
				<p>anne.herzberg-beiersdorf@hu-berlin.de</p>
				<p>Phone: </p>
				<h4>II. The rights of users and data subjects</h4>
				<p>With regard to the data processing to be described in more detail
					below, users and data subjects have the right</p>
				<ul>
					<li>
						to confirmation of whether data concerning them is being
						processed, information about the data being processed, further
						information about the nature of the data processing, and copies of
						the data (cf. also Art. 15 GDPR);
					</li>
					<li>
						to correct or complete
						incorrect or incomplete data (cf. also Art. 16 GDPR);
					</li>
					<li>
						to the immediate deletion of data concerning them
						(cf. also Art. 17 DSGVO), or, alternatively, if further
						processing is necessary as stipulated in Art. 17 Para. 3 GDPR,
						to restrict said processing per Art. 18 GDPR;
					</li>
					<li>
						to receive copies of the data concerning them and/or provided by
						them and to have the same transmitted to other providers/controllers (cf. also Art. 20 GDPR);
					</li>
					<li>to file complaints with the supervisory authority if they believe
						that data concerning them is being processed by the controller in
						breach of data protection provisions (see also Art. 77 GDPR).
					</li>
				</ul>
				<p>In addition, the controller is obliged to inform all recipients
					to whom it discloses data of any such corrections, deletions, or
					restrictions placed on processing the same per Art. 16, 17 Para. 1,
					18 GDPR. However, this obligation does not apply if such notification
					is impossible or involves a disproportionate effort. Nevertheless, users
					have a right to information about these recipients.
				</p>
				<p>Likewise, under Art. 21 GDPR, users and data subjects
					have the right to object to the controller's future processing
					of their data pursuant to Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR.
					In particular, an objection to data processing for the purpose
					of direct advertising is permissible.
				</p>
				<h4>III. Information about the data processing</h4>
				<p>Your data processed when using our website will be deleted
					or blocked as soon as the purpose for its storage ceases to
					apply, provided the deletion of the same is not in breach of any s
					tatutory storage obligations or unless otherwise stipulated below.
				</p>
				<h4>Server data</h4>
				<p>For technical reasons, the following data sent by your internet browser
					to our CDN (Content Delivery Network) will be collected, especially to ensure
					a secure and stable website: These server log files record the type and
					version of your browser, operating system, the website from which you
					came (referrer URL), the webpages on our site visited, the date and time
					of your visit, as well as the IP address from which you visited our site.
					Our website is provided via the CDN Netlify (Privacy Policy: <a href="https://www.netlify.com/privacy/">https://www.netlify.com/privacy/</a>)
				</p>
				<p>
					The data thus collected will be temporarily stored, but not in association with any other of your data.
				</p>
				<p>
					The basis for this storage is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. f) GDPR. Our legitimate
					interest lies in the improvement, stability, functionality, and security
					of our website.
				</p>
				<p>
					The data will be deleted within no more than seven
					days, unless continued storage is required for evidentiary purposes.
					In which case, all or part of the data will be excluded from deletion
					until the investigation of the relevant incident is finally resolved.
				</p>
				<h4>Contact</h4>
				<p>
					If you contact us via email or the contact form, the data you provide
					will be used for the purpose of processing your request. We must have
					this data in order to process and answer your inquiry; otherwise we
					will not be able to answer it in full or at all. Form submissions to
					our contact form are sent to Netlify.
				</p>
				<p>
					The legal basis for this data processing is Art. 6 Para. 1 lit. b) GDPR.
				</p>
				<p>Your data will be deleted once we have fully answered your
					inquiry and there is no further legal obligation to store your
					data, such as if an order or contract resulted therefrom.</p>
